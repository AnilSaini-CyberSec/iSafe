Cyber security awareness is very important to everyone whether he/she is working in any organisation, independent professional, home maker or a student. Cyber Criminal are targeting everyone with the help of malware, account hijacking, phishing, SMishing, exploiting vulnerabilities in phones or Laptops, credential stuffing etc.

Once people know what is the motive of cyber criminals, what tools and technology they are using for cyber crimes and who are their potential targets, then they will be able to act accordingly to the cyber criminal's attacks and protect themselves. People will also come to know, how their actions impact cyber security posture of organisation, their social media profile, bank accounts, phone wallet security etc and they will not only detect attacks from cyber criminals but also they will report such incidents quickly to relevant authority.

> Cyber security awareness has not increased proportional to technology in our lifestyle.

As per attacks statics for a Q1 2020, individuals are the preferred targets for Cyber criminals. One of the reason for targeting individuals is lack of awareness among people. As technology has become very important part of our life in socialising, banking, shopping or office job related activities, cyber criminals are eyeing our interaction with technology and exploiting it for their personal gain.
